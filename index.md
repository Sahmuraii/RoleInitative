# Project Description
RoleInitiative is a comprehensive digital toolset designed to elevate the Dungeons & Dragons experience by combining the best features of popular platforms into a single, intuitive solution. Developed for your use, RoleInitiative aims to streamline game management for both new and veteran players, offering a suite of tools to enhance every aspect of the game.
This project aims to take inspiration from platforms such as D&DBeyond, Roll20, and OwlBear Rodeo. The key features this platform incorporates is character creation, homebrew content creation management, and a interactive digital map in the near future. We also plan to incorporate campaign management where you can easily manage the content shared in a campaign easily and user content management that will allow easier use of sharing homebrew content between your friends. The platform will offer easy-to-use interfaces and step-by-step tutorials in order to assist new players with aspects of the game while streamlining the process for veteran players. Beginners can benefit from having user-friendly tools, tutorials, and guidance in character creation, making it easier to start playing D&D without needing to learn all the rules at once. Veterans can benefit from using this tool to streamline gameplay, manage character sheets digitally, and access a vast library of content, including official books and homebrew options. The development team will be divided by tasks with each member choosing what they want to work on from the task list, with responsibilities ranging from server-side logic and database management to user interface design and API integration. We aim to first push out a system that allows users to create characters and add homebrew content to their accounts and therefore their characters. After that we will focus our work on a system that allows the sharing of content, such as characters and homebrew creations, between users through a marketplace system that allows users to easily go in and add publicly shared content from the marketplace to their account freely.
